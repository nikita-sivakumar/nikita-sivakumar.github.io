    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>My passion for computational biology started when I was an undergraduate at the University of Virginia.
        As a biomedical engineering major and computer science minor, I had the opportunity to integrate statistical 
        and computational approaches to deepen our understanding of biology. Under the mentorship of Dr. Shayn Peirce-Cottler 
        and Dr. Matthew Lazzara, I had the opportunity to develop a multi-scale, agent-based simulation to explore how signaling-induced
        differential adhesion behaviors drive multi-cell patterning during development and disease. During this research experience, I 
        built a novel pipeline that leveraged unsupervised learnign to map dynamic cell-signaling and adhesion parameterst to emergent multi-cell patterns. I
        also had the opportunity to gain practical knowlege in agent-based simulation, signaling network models, machine learning, sensitivity analysis, and parameter optimization for non-differentiable systems.
        My undergraduate research experience inspired me to pursue a PhD at Johns Hopkins University to become an expert in constructing data-driven, multi-scale computational models to identify molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease.
        My thesis work focuses on building a data-driven and mechanistic computational pipeline to elucidate how lymphocyte motility behaviors enable critical cell-cell interactions during the adaptive immune response. Over my PhD, I have also had 
        the opportunity to lend expertise to clinical collaborations focused on using computational methods to create precision care medicine solutions. These projects include identifying cell-free, methylation DNA signatures that are predictive of frailty
        and machine learning algorithms that use standardly-available measurements of the heart to predict emergent pressure-volume coupling in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
        Outside of the lab, I am also deeply passionate about mentorship and teaching.
