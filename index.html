        <h2>Nikita Sivakumar</h2>
        <p>
            I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins Univeristy. 
            Under the mentorship of Dr. Jude Phillip and Dr. Feilim Mac Gabhann, 
            I am developing data-driven and mechanistic computational pipelines to 1) identify single-cell
            lymphocyte motility behaviors and 2) map these behaviors to emergent function during the immune response.
            In addition to my thesis work,  I have had the opportunity to spearhead several projects that apply
            machine learning to improve precicision healthcare in collaboration with clinicians at Johns Hopkins.
            Prior to graduate school, I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering along with minors in computer science
            and engineering business from the University of Virginia (UVa). At UVa, I worked with Dr. Shayn
            Peirce-Cottler and Dr. Matthew Lazzara to create a multi-scale mechanistic model that elucidated
            how dynamic differential adhesion between cells induce emergent multi-cell patterning during development
            and disease. I am deeply passionate about integrating data-driven and mechanistic modeling approaches 
            to gain mechanistic insight into complex biological processes.
