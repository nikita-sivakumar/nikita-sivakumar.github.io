        <h2>Nikita Sivakumar</h2>
        <p>
            I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins Univeristy. 
            Under the mentorship of Dr. Jude Phillip and Dr. Feilim Mac Gabhann, 
            I am developing data-driven and mechanistic computational pipelines to 1) identify single-cell
            lymphocyte motility behaviors and 2) map these behaviors to emergent function during the immune response.
            In addition to my thesis work,  I have had the opportunity to spearhead several projects that apply
            machine learning to improve precicision healthcare in collaboration with clinicians at Johns Hopkins.
            Prior to graduate school, I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering along with minors in computer science
            and engineering business from the University of Virginia (UVa). At UVa, I worked with Dr. Shayn
            Peirce-Cottler and Dr. Matthew Lazzara to create a multi-scale mechanistic model that elucidated
            how dynamic differential adhesion between cells induce emergent multi-cell patterning during development
            and disease. I am deeply passionate about integrating data-driven and mechanistic modeling approaches 
            to gain mechanistic insight into complex biological processes.

            Data-driven, mechanistic model elucidates how single-cell lymphocyte motility behaviors drive

                    Lymphocytes rely on their ability to move to  surveil immune microenvironments and engage in critical
                    cell-cell interactions that drive the adaptive immune response. Within germinal centers,
                    B-cells and T-cells rely on motility to engage in  B-T interactions that drive antibody affinity maturation. 
                    To quantify how single-cell motility properties of lymphocytes enable their ability to interact with each other we developed PRISMM:
                    Pipeline for Recapitualating cell-cell Interactions from Spatial Motility Modelling:
                    <ul>
                        <li>PRISMM first uses unsupervised machine learning to identify emergent lymphocyte motility behaviors 
                        from three-dimensional, time-lapse intravital images of mouse germinal centers.</li>
                        <li>PRISMM then uses mechanistic, agent-based simulations to recapitulate observed motility behaviors 
                        at single-cell resolution and predict how these behaviors influence B-T interactions. </li>
                        <li>Our pipeline suggests that B-cells move slower, while T-cells take on faster and more exploratory trajectories. 
                        Moreover, our simulations indicate that slow-moving B-cells can experience comparable unique cell-cell interactions with T-cells 
                        as fast-moving B-cells. This suggests that the natural decision of B-cells to move slower may enable these cells 
                        to conserve energy for other processe without sacrificing surveillance ability.</li>

            Identifying emergent signatures of cell-free DNA methylation signatures.

                    As our cells proliferate, DNA is naturally relesed by cells. Analyzing the methylation signatures of cell-free DNA 
                    collected by liquid biopsy can help us trace which tissues these cel-free DNA originated from.
                    Here we analyzed cell-free DNA methylation signatures from a cohort of RUSH patients. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unsupervised clusterin of the signatures indicated three predominant signatures: erythrocyte-dominated, immune-dominated,
                            and cariovascular-dominated signatures.
                        </li>
                        <li>Patients with the cardiovascular cell-free DNA signature were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease.</li>
                        <li>Patients with cardiovascular and immune cell-free DNA signatures were more likely to develop frailty.</li>

            Machine learning to map standardly available clinical measurements to gold-standard pressure-volume loop phenotypes

                    Deriving pressure volume loops is the gold standard for measuring coupling between the right ventrial and pulmonary artery (RV - PA coupling)
                    in patients with pulmonary hypertension. While RV-PA coupling critically predicts prognosis, this is a highly invasive and expensive clinical procedure.
                    We sought to predict how standarly available measures of the heart (e.g. hemodynamics, MRI) could be predictive of RV-PA coupling states.
                    <ul>
                        <li>We applied unsupervised clustering to derive three novel PV-loop phenotypes with distinct times to clinical worsening</li>
                        <li>We trained a supervised machine learning model that integrated standardly available measurements of the heart to predict
                            PV-loop phenotypes with high accuracy.
